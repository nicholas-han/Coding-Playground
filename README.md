This repo contains my coding pratices such as coding interview questions I collected.


#### Good Coding Habits
 * writing clear, self-explanatory code is more powerful than comments, as comments may not be updated in time and always take much space to reduce readability of code.
 * indentation (personally find column=80 to be too short, 120 is pretty reasonable.)
  * put arguments together
  * clear and meaningful indentation. Don't accumulate things to the right end.
 * naming
  * stay concise, get rid of vague or abstract words
  * ArithmeticException --> InvalidArithmetic
