#### Good Coding Habits
* good coding habits ([seven ineffective coding habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsHMHukIlJY))
 * writing clear, self-explanatory code is more powerful than comments, as comments may not be updated in time and always take much space to reduce readability of code.
 * Why not comments for documentation?
   They will ALWAYS become wrong after some time
   They usually end up misleading more than helpful
   No one is forced to fix them in order to merge their code
   Clear code is better than any comment

 * indentation (personally find column=80 to be too short, 120 is pretty reasonable.)
  * put arguments together
  * clear and meaningful indentation. Don't accumulate things to the right end.
 * naming
  * stay concise, get rid of vague or abstract words
  * ArithmeticException --> InvalidArithmetic
